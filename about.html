    <!-- Our Story -->
    <section class="story-section">
        <h2>How Emancipation Began</h2>
        <div class="story-content">
            <p>Emancipation was born from a simple yet powerful realization: the lessons we learn as children shape the adults we become. Just as many of us were taught moral lessons through stories, warnings, and guidance as children, we can use the same approach to teach respect, consent, and equality.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>"What if we could reach children earlier, with age-appropriate content that makes learning about respect as natural as learning to share?"</p>
            </div>

            <p>Research shows that attitudes about gender, violence, and relationships begin forming as early as age 3. By the time many prevention programs reach young people, harmful patterns are already established. We asked ourselves this critical question, and Emancipation was born.</p>

            <p>We partnered with child psychologists, educators, survivors, and youth advocates to create content that's both engaging and effective. Every story, game, and scenario is designed based on developmental psychology and trauma-informed practices.</p>

            <p>Emancipation isn't just an educational platform—it's a movement to break cycles of violence before they begin, one child at a time.</p>
